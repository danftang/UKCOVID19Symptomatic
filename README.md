# Estimate of the number of Symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the UK

This data set is an estimate of the daily total number of people in the UK with symtomatic COVID-19. It is based on data collected by the COVID Symptom study app, available on [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinzoe.covid_zoe) and [Apple store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/covid-symptom-tracker/id1503529611).

The original data can be found on the [JoinZoe](https://covid.joinzoe.com/data) website, but is presented as an animated gif, which isn't very convenient for analysis. Here I've transcribed the data to a csv file for convenience. I'll update these as new data becomes available on the joinzoe webiste.

On 10th May the UK Government [changed their advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-10-may-2020) from "stay at home" to "stay alert"; these are the case counts for May 2020:

and, to put that in context, here are the counts since data was available:

They aren't updating the total count every day, but they are updating the map most days. Here are the maps for 17th and 21st May:
