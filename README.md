# UKCOVID19Symptomatic

This data set is an estimate of the total number of people in the UK with symtomatic COVID-19. It is based on the data collected by the COVID Symptom study app, available on [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinzoe.covid_zoe) and [Apple store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/covid-symptom-tracker/id1503529611).

The original data can be found on the [JoinZoe](https://covid.joinzoe.com/data) website, but is presented as an animated gif, which isn't very convenient for analysis. Here we've transcribed the data to a csv file for convenience.

These are the values for May 2020:
