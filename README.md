# Estimate of the number of Symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the UK

This data set contains estimates of the daily total number of people in the UK with symtomatic COVID-19. It is based on data collected by the COVID Symptom study app, available on [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinzoe.covid_zoe) and [Apple store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/covid-symptom-tracker/id1503529611).

Daily estimates are posted on the [JoinZoe](https://covid.joinzoe.com/data) website along with historical data, rounded to the nearest 10,000. Here I've transcribed the daily, un-rounded data to a csv file for convenience. I'll update these as new data becomes available on the joinzoe webiste.

these are the case counts from May 2020:

and, to put that in context, here are the counts since data was available:
